**Noise in Documents**: Ever so very occasionally, we find that redacted documents will break down when you upload them. GraphicsMagick, which we use to break out images of each page in your document, seems to sometimes choking on the redactions. We've found that re-saving a document in Acrobat or Mac's Preview can help mitigate this. If that isn't working, let us know and we'll help you figure it out.
 
**No Text At All**: *Why do some documents have no text at all?* If you've got high quality text information already, we don't want to replace your text with ours, so when you upload a document, our system looks for a few clues that a document already has OCR information. Sometimes, though, documents give out mixed signals. If you've got a document that didn't OCR at all, let us know about it. For one thing, we can get it OCRd for you. For another, we want to know when our system is making poor assumptions.
 
**Document Import Failed**: We're always (with your help) discovering new and different ways to break our document importer. That is a good thing: it is one of the ways you're helping us make DocumentCloud better. In some cases, resolving a document import issue is as simple as opening the document in Acrobat or Preview, optimizing it for web use and re-saving it (they both have menu options named appropriately).
 
**Encrypted or Secured Documents**: It is not unheard of for government agencies to release public documents that make use of usage restriction or monitoring capacities of PDFs. DocumentCloud can't process a locked or password protected PDF, but you may have good options for unlocking them. If your operating system or print dialog includes a "Print to file" or "Print to PDF" option, you should be able to print a new document which DocumentCloud will be able to work with.
 
**More tools**: Don't have access to Adobe Acrobat or Mac's Preview? There's actually a world of great pdf editors out there (and no shortage of not so great ones) but here are some we've tested out.

For Anyone
If you're comfortable working with command line tools (or would like to get more comfortable) pdftk is a great resource--you can burst one document into many, merge many into one, rotate documents and more.
 
For Windows Users
If you're on Windows and don't have Acrobat already (or just have Acrobat Reader), you might get some mileage out of PDFill's PDF Tools (via Lifehacker). You'll need to cough up $19.99 to get rid of the ads, but even in the free version you'll be able to rotate, merge, split and watermark documents. Their install process is a bit confusing: you have to install their full suite, which includes three different programs. To rotate a document, use PDF Tools, not PDF Editor.
