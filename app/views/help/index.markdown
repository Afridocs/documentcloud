# Welcome to DocumentCloud

From the workspace, you can:

  * [Search][] the existing repository of public documents.
  * [Upload document files][] of your own.
  * View lists of entities mentioned by documents, and search for specific entities by name.
  * [Annotate documents][] with notes and navigation.
  * Organize projects of documents and notes, and [share them][] with collaborators.
  * [Publish documents][] by embedding them on your web site.
  * [Walk through a guided tour][] of the workspace.


## Finding Your Way Around the Workspace

If you're looking at a list of documents (search results, your documents, a single project) you can click on a thumbnail image to select that document. It works the same way as icons on your desktop: you can use the shift or control (command) keys to select multiple documents at once. With documents selected, you can use the toolbar to edit titles and descriptions, change privacy settings, add documents to new projects or plot them on a timeline.

If you're just looking to get started, try searching the documents already in the repository. Click on the "[Documents][]" tab and try a regular full-text search such as "[obama health care][]", or a more specific fielded search, such as "[person:geithner term:regulator][]".
