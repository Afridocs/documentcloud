# Welcome to the DocumentCloud Workspace

The workspace is your tool to work with DocumentCloud. Using it, you can:

  * [Search][] the existing repository of public documents.
  * [Upload document files][] of your own.
  * View lists of entities mentioned by documents, and search for specific entities by name.
  * [Annotate documents][] with notes and navigation.
  * Organize projects of documents and notes, and [share them][] with collaborators.
  * [Publish documents][] by embedding them on your web site.

Get started by searching the documents already in the repository. Click on the "[Documents][]" tab, above, and try a regular full-text search, such as "[obama health care][]", or a more specific fielded search, such as "[person:geithner term:regulator][]".

For more information on specific topics, open the "Guides &amp; How To's" menu above.
