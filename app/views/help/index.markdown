# Welcome to DocumentCloud

Get started by searching the documents already in the repository or by 
uploading some of your own.

Once you've uploaded a document, click on its thumbnail to select it, or
shift-click the thumbnail to select all of the documents. Clicking the
title of a document will open a document viewer, where you can read
and annotate it. Keep your documents organized by creating projects 
and dragging documents into them.

You can also search the rest of the repository using the search box in
the "Documents" tab, above.
Try a regular full-text search, such as
<a href="#search/obama%20health%20care">"obama health care"</a>, or a more
specific fielded search, such as 
<a href="#search/person%3Ageithner%20term%3Aregulator">"person:geithner term:regulator"</a>.
