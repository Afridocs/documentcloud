  * Organize projects of documents and notes, and [share them][] with collaborators.

  * [Walk through a guided tour][] of the workspace.


## Finding Your Way Around the Workspace

If you're looking at a list of documents (search results, your documents, a single project) you can click on a thumbnail image to select that document. It works the same way as icons on your desktop: you can use the shift or control (command) keys to select multiple documents at once. With documents selected, you can use the toolbar to edit titles and descriptions, change privacy settings, add documents to new projects or plot them on a timeline.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Double-click a document's title to launch a viewer, where you can edit and annotate the document, if it belongs to you.
=======
If you're just looking to get started, try searching the documents already in the repository. Click on the "[Documents][]" tab and try a regular full-text search such as "[obama health care][]", or a more specific fielded search, such as "[person:geithner term:regulator][]".
