# Scanning
 
The better your scan quality, the better our OCR will be able to read your document. However, the bigger your file size, the longer your document will take to process. We've found that reducing a document in Acrobat or Preview (both of which have a "ready for web" option) we can process your document much more quickly. Their default web resolution seems to be good enough that it doesn't interfere with OCR. Need more help [troubleshooting docs](#)?
 
# OCR

If you have access to high quality OCR, we recommend that you OCR your document before you upload it to DocumentCloud. 
 
We're using an OCR program called [Tesseract](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/). For an absolutely free tool, it is actually pretty impressive, but you'll get better results with some of the fancier proprietary services like Abbyy or Nuance. Many of the fancier office photocopiers have built-in OCR these days, so that's another option if you have some documents that are difficult to read.
