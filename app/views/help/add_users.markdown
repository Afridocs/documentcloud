# Adding Users

As the first user, you're probably going to want to add the rest of your newsroom to DocumentCloud. Luckily, that is easy to do. Once you're logged in, you'll see a link to "show all accounts" at the lower left. Click it.

There, you'll find a screen where you can add new accounts by clicking the "New Account" button. There are two categories of users. The most notable difference between a "contributor"  and an "administrator" is that only administrators can add new users. An administrator will also be able to edit the public notes and document metadata (including the title, source and description) of any user who is part of the same publication.

You can also tweak your name here (did we call you "David" when really your bylines say "Dave"?) or change the email address you use to log in. We're pulling thumbnail images from [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) currently. You can create an account there if you really want to, but for the time being your avatar won't appear outside of the workspace. So no one but you ever actually sees it.
