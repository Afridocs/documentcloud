# A Bit About Public Documents
 
We have not yet exposed public document searches, but we will do that soon. You should assume that any documents you make public in DocumentCloud will eventually be accessible to the general public through the same sort of search of our repository as you've been using as a beta tester. We have more than a few rivers cross before we're ready to make that happen, but we're working towards truly public searches of the repository. In other words, *right now, no one can see your "public" documents unless they're a registered user who is part of our beta. Soon, "public" documents will be truly public*.
 
# Ready to Publish Documents?

We're keeping a list of some of our [favorite embedded documents](#), though it is by no means comprehensive.  If you've done some great reporting that isn't there, let us know about it. 

You can now download a document viewer with all of your annotations right in it or cut and paste the code you need to embed a document on your own site straight from the DocumentCloud workspace.
 
# Caveats

DocumentCloud is still actively in beta. That means a lot of things, but when it comes to embedding documents it means this: First, you are reliant on our servers. This means that if our servers go down your document goes down. You can host documents yourself, but you'll miss out on bug fixes and we don't recommend it yet. Second, we can't make any promises. We test our work well, but we are actively working on this software and vulnerable to hosting glitches. Take a look at our terms and conditions for a fuller disclaimer of liability.
 
# Step 1: Create a Template

If you want your readers to view a document, you'll need to embed it on your website. For that, you need a template. It should be fluid-width, with just a header -- the viewer will take up the rest of the page.
 
Here are some live examples worth checking out: [NewsHour](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/stevens-testimony.html), [Arizona Republic](http://www.azdatapages.com/sb1070.html), [Chicago Tribune](http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/docs/obama-subpoena.html), [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/documents/item/magnetars-responses-to-our-questions), but there are [plenty more](#).
 
Each news organization has produced a layout, with their own logo, links, analytics and advertising. When working on a layout to wrap the document viewer, we recommend allowing the viewer to be fluid-width, and not placing any footer at the bottom of the page, as the viewer takes care of scrolling the page itself.
 
# Step 2: Check Your Meta Data

Before you embed a document on your site, be sure it has a clear title, description and source. If you want readers to be able to find the accompanying article, be sure to add a link to your related reporting.
 
**Title**: Does the title in DocumentCloud match the title you're planning for the page?
**Description**: Some users will come straight to the document rather than finding it through an article, so be sure the description field has enough information to put the document in context.
**Source**: Currently, DocumentCloud's embeddable viewer doesn't include the information from the "source" field, but this should still be accurate.
**Related Article**: Definitely supply the URL for the related news story so that readers can find their way back to the reporting on the document.
 
Almost all of these fields can be edited as a batch: select as many documents as you're getting ready to publish and click on the "edit" menu. Each document's title and description must be edited separately.
 
# Step 3: Make Your Documents Public

To publish a document, you'll need to first select the document (or as many documents as you're ready to publish) and then select "Edit Access Level" from the menu "Edit" menu. Change the access level to "Public" and then open each document.
 
Note: once you change a document to "public" other users of DocumentCloud will be able to find it in searches of the repository. Don't make sensitive documents public in advance of publication! 
 
# Step 4: Download the HTML

Select a document and then look at the Publish menu for options. Note: at this stage, you can only embed documents you own.

# Step 5: Paste the HTML in Your Template

You won't be able to access your public documents directly on our site unless you are logged in, but you will be able to post a viewer in your template. Here's some sample viewer HTML. You'll notice, if you study it closely, that the URL for the document javascript looks remarkably like the document's own URL: only the file extension is changed, from html to js.
 
# Step 6: Stay in Touch

Let us know about your reporting. Even if it is "just a little local story" -- we're interested in all the reporting you do with DocumentCloud, not just work with national significance.
