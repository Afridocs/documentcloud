# Document Modification

We don't tend to think of modifying source documents as something a responsible journalist would do, but there are absolutely times when you need to. Whether you're trying to protect the privacy of a minor by redacting personally identifying information from a foster care incident report, reorganizing a collection of letters or inserting a page that wasn't properly scanned, reporters do sometimes need to rework source documents in order to display them. Select the document that needs correction, and look in the "Edit" menu for the specific tool you need.

Within the pages tab of any document that you have permission to edit, you'll find page manipulation tools in the sidebar on the right-hand side. As you save changes to the pages, the document window will close so DocumentCloud can rebuild your document. Depending on the size of your document and the number of other jobs being handled at the time, this can take a while. Your changes to the document will also be applied to the original PDF file.

 * Select **Insert/Replace Pages** and click the space between any two pages to insert pages. Select any single page to replace that page. Hold the shift key and select multiple pages to replace an entire section of the document. When you're ready to proceed, click the "Upload Pages" button to choose a file from your computer to insert or replace the chosen pages.

 * Select **Remove Pages** and click once on each page that should be removed from the document. Click the page again to pull it out of the "remove" queue. Use the "Remove Pages" button to save your work.

 * To reorganize a document, click **Reorder Pages** and drag and drop the pages you'd like to move into their new locations. Use "Save Page Order" to save your work.

Need to clean up OCR gibberish? Edit the text that appears in DocumentCloud's text tab with the **Edit Page Text** option. As you make changes to individual pages, you'll see a thumbnail in your activity tray. If you want to undo your edits, you can revert the text of any page by hovering over it in the activity tray and clicking on the **(x)** icon.

You can use the back and forward arrows at the top of the sidebar to page through the document. When you click the "Save Text" button DocumentCloud will store your changes and update the search index and entity list for that document. Changes made with **Edit Page Text** will not alter the original PDF. 

Use **Reprocess Text** to take advantage of improvements to DocumentCloud's text processing tools. As we work, DocumentCloud is continually improving the tools we provide to users. If we [improve the quality of our OCR][] tools, you can try processing an old document anew for better results. By default, DocumentCloud tries to use the text content embedded in the PDF file, if available. If you know that this text is incorrect, and you would prefer to have DocumentCloud use Tesseract to extract the text via optical character recognition, choose the **Force OCR** option.
