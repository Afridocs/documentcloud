# Guided Tour
 
Create a project called "Demo Documents". Projects keep documents organized, allowing you to restrict your searches to a limited group of documents, and making it possible to collaborate on sets of documents with other reporters.

Run an example search for [gulf oil spill][]
  
This will return a list of documents with all of the three words present in the text or title of the document. You can [refine your search by special criteria][], as well.
 
Your results should include a number of documents relating to the British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. You can drag a number of these documents into your "Demo Documents" project to keep them handy for future reference. Double-click the document title to launch it in a viewer.

If the document has public notes, made by the contributing reporter, you'll be able to see them here. You can make [your own private notes][] on the document, and those won't be visible to anyone but you.
 
Try searching for [source: "House Committee on the Judiciary"][]
 
This should pull up a handful of documents related to a DOJ report on Bush administration interrogation policies. When a document is uploaded, we run it through OCR and a handful of other processing tools. If you select all 8 of the interrogation documents and click the "Timeline" button, you can see all the dates named in these documents plotted on a timeline. Hover over a dot to see the exact date mentioned, and click on a dot to view the date in the text of the document.

Close the timeline and click over to the "Entities" tab, at the top left of the screen. This will show you a series of expandable lists of the **people**, **organizations**, **places**, and **terms** mentioned in the documents. You'll see "John Yoo" at the top of the list, with the counter `(8)` next to his name, because he's named in all eight of the documents. Click his name to refine your search, and then click the "show pages" link that appears right next to it. Underneath each document, you'll now see thumbnails of each page that mentions John Yoo, and can click on any of the thumbnails to jump directly to his name on that particular page.
