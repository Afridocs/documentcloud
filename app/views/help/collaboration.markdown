# Collaboration

You already know you can <a href="/help/privacy#access">share documents with everyone in your newsroom</a>. You can also organize documents into projects and share them with other DocumentCloud users, whether or not they're in your newsroom. 

Collaboration in DocumentCloud is based around projects: sharing a project with another user gives them access to view and edit all of the documents in that project and all the public notes on those documents. Your private notes will still be private. 

To start sharing, you'll need to know the email address that each collaborator uses to log in to DocumentCloud. Click any project's edit icon <span class="icon edit_glyph" style="padding-left:16px;position:relative;top: -2px;">&#65279;</span> and use "Add a collaborator to this project" to enter each email address (you'll need to use the address they use to log in to DocumentCloud). 

<img src="/images/help/show_collaborator.png" class="full_line" />

Shared projects will appear in each collaborator's sidebar and they will be able to view, edit, and annotate all documents in the project. They'll also be able to add new documents to the project, which will in turn be available to you.

Collaborating with a reporter who isn't on DocumentCloud? They should <a href="/contact">join</a>!
