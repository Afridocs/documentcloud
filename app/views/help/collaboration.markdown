# Collaboration

When you're working with other reporters on a project, you can share a set of documents and notes with them, even if they're in a completely different news organization. Collaboration in DocumentCloud is based around projects: sharing a project with someone gives them access to view and edit all of the documents and public notes inside.

If you have a project you'd like to share, click on it's edit icon <span class="icon edit_glyph" style="padding-left:16px;position:relative;top: -2px;">&nbsp;</span> to open up the "Edit Project" dialog. Click on the "Add a collaborator to this project" link, and type in the email address of the person you'd like to share the project with. This must be the same email address that they use to log in to DocumentCloud. Click "Add". At this point, you should see them appear, listed under "Collaborators", in the project.

The next time your partner logs in to DocumentCloud, the project you shared will show up in their sidebar. Your partner can now view, edit, and annotate all of the documents inside of it. If they add documents of their own to the project, you'll be able to see and edit those documents as well.
