# Annotate Documents: Public, Private, and Draft Notes

![Annotations][]

DocumentCloud suppports both private and public notes. Public notes are visible to anyone who has access to the  document, while private notes are only ever visible to their author. Public notes may also be saved as drafts: draft notes are visible to anyone with the privileges neccessary to annotate a document, including <a href="collaboration">reviewers and collaborators</a>, but they won't be published with the document. 

Annotate any document by opening and selecting either "Add a public note" or "Add a private note" as appropriate. Your cursor should change to crosshairs: click and drag to select the area you'd like to highlight. When you release the cursor, you will be able to add and save your note. 

To annotate a page *in general* rather than a region of the page, hover annotation crosshair in the gutter between pages. A note tab and dotted line will appear &mdash; click near the line to create a note that sits in between the pages.

It is not possible to resize a note. Instead, copy the contents, delete the existing note, and redraw it.

![Notes Link][]

Notes on a document are available in the workspace as well as in the open document. Use the the "notes" link underneath any document thumbnail to display *all* of the document's notes in the workspace. Each note's title links to that note in the document viewer. If you have permission to edit a document, you can also edit the notes from inside the workspace itself. If you're changing notes in the workspace and in the document viewer simultaneously, you may need to refresh the page in order to see all the latest changes.

## <span id="linking">Linking to Notes</span>

Link directly to [any note][]: to find the URL (or permalink) of a note, open the note and select the link icon <span class="icon permalink" style="padding-left:16px;position:relative;top: -2px;">&#65279;</span>. Your browser's address bar will be updated to display the full URL of the annotation. The good stuff comes after the # symbol &emdash; in our [example][] the URL of the embedded document ends with <code>#document/p173/a8646</code>, so we know that the annotation is on page 173. The annotation itself is identifed by a random string (in this case "a8646"). 

You can also embed a note directly. See our <a href="publishing">publishing and embedding</a> documentation for details.

## <span id="printing">Printing Notes</span>

![Print Notes][]

It's easy to print out all the notes on a particular document or collection of documents. If you're in the workspace, select the documents with notes that you'd like to print, open the "Publish" menu, and click "Print Notes". While viewing a document, you'll find the link to "Print Notes" in the sidebar.


# <span id="sections">Adding Sections for Navigation</span>

To help differentiate portions of a long document, you can add navigation links to the sidebar by defining sections. Inside of the document viewer, click on "Edit Sections" to open the Section Editor dialog. Add a title, starting page, and ending page for each section you'd like to define. Use the plus and minus icons to add and remove rows. When you're done, don't forget to save.
