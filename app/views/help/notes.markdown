# Adding Public and Private Notes

![Annotations][]

There are two kinds of notes: public and private. Public notes are always displayed to everyone who as access to your document. Private notes are only  visible to you. You can distinguish the two by color: public notes appear in yellow, while private ones are blue, with a lock. While you're viewing a document, you can add a note by selecting one of the two links ("Add a public note" or "Add a private note"). Your cursor should change to crosshairs: click and drag to select the area you'd like to highlight. When you release the mouse you will be able to edit and save your note.

Although the viewer won't complain if you try &mdash; it's not recommended to try and annotate across multiple pages at once.
 
Currently you can't resize a note, you have to copy the contents, delete the existing note and redraw it.

![Notes Link][]

The notes that you add to a document become visible in the workspace as well. Clicking the "notes" link underneath a document will display *all* of the document's notes in a list beneath. If you have permission to edit the document, you can also edit the notes from within the workspace.

# Adding Sections for Navigation

To help highlight different sections of a long document, you can add navigation links to the sidebar. Inside of the document viewer, click on "Edit Sections" to open up the Section Editor dialog, which contains a numbered list of sections. For each section, enter the title, the page number of the start of the section, and the page number of the end. If you need to add or remove sections, click on the plus and minus icons. When you're finished, hit "Save", and the navigation will update.
