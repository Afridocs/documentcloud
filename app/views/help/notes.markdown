# Adding Public, Private, and Draft Notes

![Annotations][]

There are three kinds of notes: public, private, and draft. Public notes are always displayed to everyone who as access to your document. Private notes are only visible to you. Draft notes are only displayed to other people in your organization, but not the general public. You can distinguish between public and private by color: public notes appear in yellow, while private ones are blue, with a lock. Draft notes are yellow like public notes, but have a red dot or a red [DRAFT] notice. 

Draft notes can be published by editing the note and clicking on the "Publish" button. Similarly, public notes can be moved into draft status by clicking the "Save as Draft" button while editing the note. Draft notes can only be seen by collaborators on the document, whereas public notes can be seen by everybody viewing the document.

While you're viewing a document, you can add a note by selecting one of the two links ("Add a public note" or "Add a private note"). Your cursor should change to crosshairs: click and drag to select the area you'd like to highlight. When you release the mouse you will be able to edit and save your note.

If you'd like to add a note not to a particular region of a page, but to a page *in general*, hover the crosshair in the gutter between pages. You will see a note tab and a dotted line appear &mdash; click near the line to create a note that sits in between the pages.

Currently you can't resize a note: you have to copy the contents, delete the existing note and redraw it.

![Notes Link][]

The notes that you add to a document become visible in the workspace as well. Clicking the "notes" link underneath a document will display *all* of the document's notes in a list beneath. Click on a note's title to jump to that note in the document viewer. If you have permission to edit the document, you can also edit the notes from inside the workspace itself. If you're changing notes in the workspace and in the document viewer simultaneously, you may need to refresh the page in order to see all the latest changes.

## <span id="linking">Linking to Notes</span>

You can link directly to an existing annotation, [like this one][]: to find the URL (or permalink) that will open the document right to a particular annotation, just open the annotation and click on the link icon <span class="icon permalink" style="padding-left:16px;position:relative;top: -2px;">&#65279;</span>. Your browser's address bar will be updated to display the URL of that annotation. The good stuff comes after the # symbol &emdash; in [our example][] the URL of the embedded document ends with <code>#document/p173/a8646</code>, so we know that the annotation is on page 173. The annotation itself is identifed by a random string (in this case "a8646"). 


## <span id="sections">Adding Sections for Navigation</span>

To help differentiate portions of a long document, you can add navigation links to the sidebar by defining sections. Inside of the document viewer, click on "Edit Sections" to open the Section Editor dialog. Add a title, starting page, and ending page for each section you'd like to define. Use the plus and minus icons to add and remove rows. When you're done, don't forget to save.
