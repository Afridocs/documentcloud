# Adding Public and Private Notes

![Annotations][]

There are two kinds of notes: public and private. Public notes are always displayed to everyone who as access to your document. Private notes are only  visible to you. You can distinguish the two by color: public notes appear in yellow, while private ones are blue, with a lock. While you're viewing a document, you can add a note by selecting one of the two links ("Add a public note" or "Add a private note"). Your cursor should change to crosshairs: click and drag to select the area you'd like to highlight. When you release the mouse you will be able to edit and save your note.

If you'd like to add a note not to a particular region of a page, but to a page *in general*, hover the crosshair in the gutter between pages. You will see a note tab and a dotted line appear &mdash; click near the line to create a note that sits in between the pages.

Currently you can't resize a note, you have to copy the contents, delete the existing note and redraw it.

![Notes Link][]

The notes that you add to a document become visible in the workspace as well. Clicking the "notes" link underneath a document will display *all* of the document's notes in a list beneath. Click on a note's title to jump to that note in the document viewer. If you have permission to edit the document, you can also edit the notes from inside the workspace itself. If you're changing notes in the workspace and in the document viewer simultaneously, you may need to refresh the page in order to see all the latest changes.

You can link directly to any existing annotation, [like this one][]. To find the permalink for an annotation, open it, and click on the link icon <span class="icon permalink" style="padding-left:16px;position:relative;top: -2px;">&#65279;</span>. The URL for the annotation will appear in your browser's address bar, where you can copy it.

## Adding Sections for Navigation

To help highlight different sections of a long document, you can add navigation links to the sidebar. Inside of the document viewer, click on "Edit Sections" to open up the Section Editor dialog, which contains a numbered list of sections. For each section, enter the title, the page number of the start of the section, and the page number of the end. If you need to add or remove sections, click on the plus and minus icons. When you're finished, hit "Save", and the navigation will update.
