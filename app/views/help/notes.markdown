# Document Notes

You have two options as you're preparing documents for publication (or just working with them) ... you can create a table of contents by organizing the documents into sections, and you can add notes to specific areas of a document.

There are two kinds of notes: public and private. Public notes are always displayed to everyone who has access to your document. Private notes are only  visible to you. You can distinguish the two by color: public notes appear in yellow, while private ones are blue, with a lock. While you're viewing a document, you can add a note by selecting one of the two links ("Add a public note" or "Add a private note") Your cursor should change to crosshairs: click and drag to select the area you'd like to highlight. When you release the mouse you will be able to edit and save your note.
 
Currently you can't resize a note, you have to delete and redraw it.
