# Adding Public and Private Notes

![Annotations][]

There are two kinds of notes: public and private. Public notes are always displayed to everyone who as access to your document. Private notes are only  visible to you. You can distinguish the two by color: public notes appear in yellow, while private ones are blue, with a lock. While you're viewing a document, you can add a note by selecting one of the two links ("Add a public note" or "Add a private note"). Your cursor should change to crosshairs: click and drag to select the area you'd like to highlight. When you release the mouse you will be able to edit and save your note.

Although the viewer won't complain if you try &mdash; it's not recommended to try and annotate across multiple pages at once.
 
Currently you can't resize a note, you have to copy the contents, delete the existing note and redraw it.

The notes that you add to a document become viewable in the workspace as well.
