# Modifying Documents

Even after you have finished uploading and annotating a document, DocumentCloud can still help you manipulate and modify the document's content. Individual pages in the document may be inserted, replaced, removed and reordered. If the OCR process has produced incorrect text, the text for any page can be corrected. To get started, open the document and click on the **Pages** tab.

You'll see a menu of "Page Tools" in the sidebar on the right: "Insert/Replace Pages", "Remove Pages", "Reorder Pages". Clicking on any of these links will display instructions describing how to proceed. 

 * **Insert/Replace pages**: First, choose a location in the document to insert the page (or pages), or select a range of pages that should be replaced. When you're ready, click the **Upload Pages** button, and choose the file to be inserted.
 
 * **Remove Pages**: Click on all of the pages in the document that you would like to remove. When the list of pages is complete, click the **Remove Pages** button.

 * **Reorder Pages**: Drag and drop pages to rearrange their location within the document. When you have finished creating the desired ordering, click the **Save Page Order** button.
 
All of these operations take some time to rebuild the document. During the processing, the document will close, and will then re-appear in your workspace after the operation has finished.

## Editing Page Text

To edit a document's text, click on the **Text** tab, navigate to the page you wish to change, and click on the "Edit Page Text" link. The text will become editable.

You can use the back and forward arrows to page through the document, correcting OCR errors. When you have finished editing the text of every page you wish to change, click the **Save Text** button. DocumentCloud's search index will be updated with the corrected text, and we'll perform another round of entity extraction, to find any entities that may have been missed due to previous misspellings.
