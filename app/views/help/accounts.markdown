# How to Add Accounts

Managing your organization's DocumentCloud accounts is done through a single panel: at the bottom of the sidebar, click the "[Show All Accounts][]" link.

The dialog that opens up contains a list of all of the accounts in your organization, as well as a "New Account" button. There are two categories of users that you can add to your organization: "contributor" and "administrator". The most notable difference between the two is that only administrators are allowed to add new users.

You can also tweak your name here (did we call you "David" when really your bylines say "Dave"?) or change the email address you use to log in. If you'd like to update your password to something different, click "change password". We're pulling thumbnail images from [Gravatar][] currently. You can create an account there if you like, but for the time being your avatar won't appear outside of the workspace, and it's not a big deal if you leave it blank.

Still have questions about accounts? Don't hesitate to [contact us][].
