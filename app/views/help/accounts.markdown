# How to Add Accounts

Managing your organization's DocumentCloud accounts is done through a single panel: at the bottom of the sidebar, click the "[Manage Accounts][]" link.

The dialog that opens up contains a list of all of the accounts in your organization, as well as a "New Account" button. There are three categories of users that you can add to your organization: **contributors**, **administrators**, and **freelancers**.

 * **Contributors** are regular reporters and producers who will be uploading, annotating, and editing documents.
 
 * **Administrators** have the additional ability to create new DocumentCloud accounts, and disable old ones. Your editor or DocumentCloud point person should be an administrator.
 
 * **Freelancer** accounts are intended for people who are contributing reporting to a specific project, but shouldn't have access to the rest of your newsroom's documents.

You can also use the Accounts dialog to tweak your name (did we call you "David" when really your bylines say "Dave"?) or change the email address you use to log in. If you'd like to update your password to something different, click "change password". We're pulling thumbnail images from [Gravatar][] currently. You can create an account there if you like, but for the time being your avatar won't appear outside of the workspace, and it's not a big deal if you leave it blank.

Still have questions about accounts? Don't hesitate to [contact us][].
