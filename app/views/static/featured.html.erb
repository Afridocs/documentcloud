                  <i><a href="http://postsomerville.com/">Post Somerville</a></i> covers local politics in Somerville, MA. It is a labor of love, run by volunteers. They wanted to post municipal campaign finance records for their readers to examine. MuckRock, an innovative little shop will file freedom of information requests on behalf of interested individuals (or organizations). MuckRock helped <i>Post Somerville</i> acquire the records from the City Clerk, but faced with copying charges estimated at $100, the bloggers were not thrilled about paying out of their own pockets for the files. Instead they <a href="http://www.muckrock.com/blog/a-big-thank-you-and-a-small-milestone/">turned to Spot.us</a> to raise the copying fees from their readership. Close to two dozen readers contributed to the copying expenses.<br />

  <i>MPR News</i> published 219 pages of FBI records on Paul and Sheila Wellstone, in a story that travelled from the agency's early surveillance of Wellstone, the civil rights and anti-war activist, to their investigation into threats against Wellstone after he joined the US Senate in 1991. Throughout reporter Madeleine Baran's <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/2010/wellstone-files/feature/">feature story</a> examining the collected documents, <i>MPR News</i> used thumbnail images as pullquotes and directed readers to relevant passages that they'd highlighted in each document.<br />

  </b><br />
  Since 2001, billions of dollars in government contracts have been awarded to Alaska native corporations, or ANCs, through a program designed to support indiginous run corporations by giving them a leg up in the bidding process. A <i>Washington Post</i> investigation found that the vast majority of the money in those contracts never makes it north to Alaska. The documents they published to help make their case include <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/alaska-native/documents/anc3-agreement.html">consulting agreements</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/alaska-native/documents/anc12-request.html">letters</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/alaska-native/documents/anc1-senate.html">a senate report</a> highlighting weak oversight of the ANC program, and an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/alaska-native/documents/anc9-strategy.html">SEC filing</a>.

    A year long investigation by Memphis' <i>Commercial Appeal</i> revealed that the photographer responsible for some of the most iconic photographs of the civil rights movement, Ernest Withers, was also serving as an informant for the FBI, spying on the same civil rights leaders he befriended.

        New York City introduced paper ballots in the 2010 primary election, to comply with a 2002 federal law that mandated significant updates to voting systems in each state. Local NPR affiliate, <i>WNYC</i> invited a group of ballot design experts to review the city's new ballots. They identified a number of problems likely to trip up voters, and used DocumentCloud to flag each one for their readers. <br /><br />
        
        When officials released sample ballots for November's general election, the <a href="http://reformny.blogspot.com/2010/10/city-boards-mistake-on-ballot.html">Brennan Center discovered</a> instructions erroneously  <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/articles/its-free-country/2010/oct/21/ballot-tells-voters-fill-wrong-oval/">advising voters</a> to mark the oval above a candidate's name. In fact, the relevant ovals appear below candidate's names.
