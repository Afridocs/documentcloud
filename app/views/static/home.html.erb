  DocumentCloud is an index of primary source documents and a tool for 
  annotating, organizing and publishing them on the web.
</p>
<p>
  Documents are contributed by journalists, researchers and archivists. 
  If your organization does document-driven investigations, weâ€™d love to have 
  you join us. Using the DocumentCloud workspace, you can upload documents, 
  share them with your team, and conduct structured searches
  and analyses based on extracted entities &mdash; the people, places, and 
  organizations mentioned in the text. As a contributor, you can download a 
  lightweight document viewer to embed documents on your web site.

  use DocumentCloud to complement their reporting.

<p>
  At the moment, we're in the middle of our initial beta release. If you're a
  news organization or nonprofit that would like to join, please 
  <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As we develop the DocumentCloud application, we're packaging up the components 
  that support it, and releasing them as <a href="/opensource">open-source projects</a>.
  Our releases so far include the majority of our document processing code.
