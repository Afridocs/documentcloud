<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>If you have a question that you don’t see answered, don’t hesitate to <a href="/about">contact us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is it? </strong></p>
<p>DocumentCloud is both a repository of primary source documents and a tool for document-based investigative reporting. Think of the repository as a card catalog for primary source documents. When you upload a document to DocumentCloud, you can annotate it, see lists of people and places named in your documents, plot documents on a timeline and more. We're building tools that accelerate the work of reporters who need to make sense of large sets of documents. You can use it on small sets, too. </p>

<p><strong>Yes, but what <em>is</em> it?</strong></p>
<p>Ruby (<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>) and JavaScript. We're using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_%28software%29">Tesseract</a> for OCR and <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">OpenCalais</a> for entity extraction. Take a look at <a href="http://github.com/documentcloud">our GitHub projects</a> and <a href="/blog/author/jeremy/">Jeremy’s blog posts</a> to get a better sense of the tools we’re using.</p>

<p><strong>Is there an API?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. </p>

<p><strong>What does it cost? </strong></p>
<p>Thanks to our funding from the Knight News Challenge, DocumentCloud is free of charge.</p>

<p><strong>Who funds it? </strong></p>
<p>DocumentCloud is funded by a generous grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. We were a 2009 winner of a <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a> grant. Our grant runs two years and we’ll be soon be seeking sustaining funding. </p>

<p><strong>Why are the New York Times and ProPublica getting grant funding? </strong></p>
<p>They’re not. Journalists from the Times and ProPublica applied for the Knight News Challenge grant — and both organizations are using DocumentCloud— but Document Cloud, Inc is an independant 501c3 organization. Neither the Times nor ProPublica are receiving any money from the grant. Our three co-founders, the Times and ProPublica journalists who wrote the grant proposal, are volunteering their time. </p>

<p><strong>Why would I want to share my documents? </strong></p>
<p>Because it will make your documents and your reporting more findable, more useful and ultimately more popular. </p>
<p>We know that many journalists are already looking for better ways to share their source materials. It’s one of the reasons why most news organizations are already posting source documents alongside news stories on their Web sites. The trouble is there hasn’t been an easy way to make those documents useful or even findable after the story fades from the headlines.  </p>
<p>Many other organizations (bloggers, watchdog groups, citizen journalists) are in that same boat. They have a wealth of documents but are only able to post them as individual PDF files. Again, it’s not a lack of desire; it’s a lack of available technology. This is the problem DocumentCloud intends to solve. </p>

<p><strong>Can’t I already find documents using a search engine? </strong></p>
<p>Search engines are very powerful; our goal is to make documents even easier to find on search engines. DocumentCloud will have information about documents and relations between them, for example what locations, people, or organizations a group of documents have in common. </p>

<p><strong>How will you guarantee authenticity?</strong> </p>
<p>During our beta phase, we're limiting access to journalists and other researchers who have an established editorial process and a history of publishing high quality reporting. Each contributing organization takes responsibility for ensuring that the documents they upload to DocumentCloud are what they say they are.</p>

<p><strong>Will I be able to list documents but keep them offline until my article is published?</strong> </p>
<p>Yes. This is a project started by journalists who understand the needs of journalists and news organizations. Documents you upload aren't public until you publish them.</p>

<p><strong>Will I be able to keep my documents behind a registration wall / pay wall?</strong> </p>
<p>DocumentCloud is an index of publicly accessible source documents. Links to documents on sites with registration or reasonably priced pay walls will be allowed, but we won’t allow completely private sites.</p>

<p><strong>How can I start sharing documents?</strong></p>
<p>Send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@documentcloud.org?subject=partnership">info@documentcloud.org</a>  and let us know you’re interested. Our group of beta testers is growing every day.</p>

<p><strong>When will it be ready?</strong></p>
<p>It's ready now. If you'd like to join the beta <a href="mailto:info@documentcloud.org?subject=partnership">email us </a> with a bit of information about who you are, what you're working on and what kind of documents you're working with. </p>
