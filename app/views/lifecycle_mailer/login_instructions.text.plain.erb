<%= @account.full_name %> --

A DocumentCloud account has been created for you and <%= @organization_name %>.

Set your password and get started at: 

<%= DC_CONFIG['server_root'] %>/accounts/enable/<%= @key %>

In the future, you'll be able to login at <%= DC_CONFIG['server_root'] %>/login

At this stage in our beta, you can upload documents, make them public in our repostitory or keep them to yourself. You can explore some of our text analysis tools, make notes for yourself straight on the documents and organize your files into projects. We'll keep you posted as we add more functionality.

You can find information about using the workspace, creating accounts, searching the repository and more at http://help.documentcloud.org or write to support@documentcloud.org if you can't find what you're looking for or have great ideas about how we could make DocumentCloud even better. 

Enjoy,
