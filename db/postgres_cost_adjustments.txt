Make these Postgres cost adjustments to give the query planner a more realistic 
idea of how expensive it is to avoid the full text indexes. You need to log
in as the root user "postgres", and be on the database in question.

    alter function to_tsvector(regconfig,text) cost 100000;
    alter function ts_match_vq(tsvector,tsquery) cost 500;
