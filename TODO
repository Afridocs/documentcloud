TODO:

  * Figure out how controllers are going to work -- refactor javascripts/app/
    workspace.js accordingly.
    
  * Build out surrounding start page blips... About Us, How to Join, 
    What is This?
    
  * Create a News Organization "Signup" page.
  
  * Create a News Organization "Manage Journalists" page.
  
  * Replace raw PDF link with a DocumentViewer.
  
  * Fix up Sphinx search to use delta indexes (and sharded indexes, perhaps), 
    so that all new documents imported within, say, a five-minute period 
    go delta. To get really fancy, the delta interval can be a constant 
    multiplier of the amount of time it takes to run a full index.
    
  * Look into all the weightings and filterings that Sphinx has to offer,
    take advantage.
        
  * Replace document IDs in URLs with title-based slugs.
  
  * Pervasive P-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N
      
DONE:

  * Add a link to view the document plain text.

  * Look into Linux (or OpenCalais) automatic summary tools for the summary
    (nothing seems good enough).

  * Get Tesseract hooked up again as OCR.

  * Provide a way of deleting documents, at least temporarily, so that we can
    we-import mistyped ones, and remove garbage docs.
    
  * Implement client-side restful sets as a basic way to interact.
  
  * Replace Tokyo Dystopia with a better full text search solution.
  
  * Swap params#q search query for a hashtag-based one.

  * Access control. Lockdown.
  
  * Create an "Upload Document" UI within the journo workspace.
  
  * Enhance the Journalist Workspace with journo-specific bits -- figure out 
    the separation of their search from the common man's search.
    
  * Create a deploy rake task that updates both 'staging-central' and 
    'staging-workers', restarts cloud-crowd and document-cloud.
