How to get a development environment set up:

* Install the dependencies and gems listed in PROVISIONING, as appropriate 
  (ie, don't install Tesseract unless you're planning on doing OCR).
  
* Configure Nginx and /etc/hosts to serve dev.dcloud.org locally. An example
  Nginx configuration is stored in config/server/nginx

* Load the development_structure.sql into Postgres.

* Create your CloudCrowd database, using the config/cloud_crowd/development
  configuration folder.
  
* Start a local CloudCrowd server and node, with 
  `rake crowd:server:start crowd:node:start`
  
* Start Nginx.
