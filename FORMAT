                 take {page} as a parameter. Page numbers are 5-digits long, as

    title  : A section title is required.
    
    pages  : A comma-separated list of the page ranges that the section 
             covers. Most sections will simply look like "5-13", but a more
             complicated example could be: "2-7,13,25-62". Note that "13" and
             "13-13" are equivalent.

  annotations : [{ (optional)
  
    page      : The page number where the annotation occurs.
    
    title     : (optional) The title of the annotation.
    
    content   : (optional) The content of the annotation.

                }
                Describes the bounding box of the annotation, measured in
                pixels, relative to the default size of the page images. Or
                the offset and length of the annotation's reference in the 
                plain text. Or the id of the HTML element for the annotation.
                Leaving position unspecified means that the annotation applies
                to the entire page.
