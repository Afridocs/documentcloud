                 that can be used to reference document assets.
  
    page_image : URL template for a page image. Should take {page} and, 
                 optionally, {size}. Page numbers are 5-digits long (zero-
                 padded). Size is an opaque value (could be 'small', or '700'),
                 with the available sizes documented in your API docs.
                 Ex: http://docs.org/olympics-02/images/page-{page}-{size}.jpg
                 
    page_text  : URL template for the UTF-8 plain text of a single page. Should
                 take {page} as a parameter. Page numbers are 5-digits long, as
                 above.
                 Ex: http://docs.org/olympics-02/pages/{page}.txt

    title  : A section title is required.
    
    pages  : A comma-separated list of the page ranges that the section 
             covers. Most sections will simply look like "5-13", but a more
             complicated example could be: "2-7,13,25-62". Note that "13" and
             "13-13" are equivalent.

                  id : 'html-id'                                (for html)
                }
                Describes the bounding box of the annotation, measured in
                pixels, relative to the default size of the page images. Or
                the offset and length of the annotation's reference in the 
                plain text. Or the id of the HTML element for the annotation.
                Leaving position unspecified means that the annotation applies
                to the entire page.

Issues: Authors. Multiples (sources). Required attributes at top? Zero-padded 
        page numbers? Should 'size' be opaque? Thumbnail sizes? Standard name
        for sources (take the title of the Wikipedia page as the standard when
        in doubt)? How to deal with section-annotation ambiguity when there's
        more than one section on a page.
