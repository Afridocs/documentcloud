             covers. Most sections will simply look like "5-13", but a more
             complicated example could be: "2-7,13,25-62". Note that "13" and
             "13-13" are equivalent.

Issues: Authors. Multiples (sources). Required attributes at top?
        Should 'size' be opaque? Thumbnail sizes? Standard name
        for sources (take the title of the Wikipedia page as the standard when
        in doubt)? How to deal with section-annotation ambiguity when there's
        more than one section on a page.
